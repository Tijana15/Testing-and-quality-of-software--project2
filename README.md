# Testing-and-quality-of-software--project2

The main goal of the project is to test the CRUD operations for student data in both the client-side (Angular) and server-side (Spring Boot) applications. Specifically, the tests aim to verify the following:

Client-Side (Angular) Tests: Ensure that the correct student data is displayed in the form for adding and editing students, in the table showing all students, and in the delete student dialog. It also checks the functionality of buttons related to these actions.

Server-Side (Spring Boot) Tests: Use Postman to verify that the REST API endpoints correctly handle CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), return the correct data, and respond with appropriate status codes (e.g., 404 NOT FOUND if the student isn't found).

Additionally, the report should document the issues found in both the client-side and server-side applications during testing. The objective is to ensure the functionality works as expected and identify any bugs or discrepancies.
